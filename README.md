Customer Clustering with K-Means on Supermarket Data

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** on supermarket customer data. Customer segmentation is an essential process for identifying distinct groups within a customer base, enabling personalized marketing strategies, enhanced customer experience, and better resource allocation.

 Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and insights into customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and spending patterns.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Implementation of the K-Means algorithm to group customers based on their attributes.
- **Cluster Evaluation:** Uses metrics like the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Visualization:** Visualizes clusters using 2D and 3D plots to understand customer groupings.

#### Dataset:
The dataset includes the following attributes for supermarket customers:
- **Customer ID**
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

#### Tools and Libraries:
- **Python**
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
  - `scikit-learn` for clustering and evaluation.


#### Future Enhancements:
- Implement additional clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering).
- Add support for other datasets with similar structures.
- Incorporate customer segmentation visualizations into a web dashboard.
